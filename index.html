<p>The Fabled Fumbler himself made his first splash on the Asian scene back in early 2022, alongside the workshop patch. After making an outstanding run at Rivals Reset, Splash became a dominant force in Asia, placing 5th at Mauripop's Evil Incorporated and Skill Issue. He also placed 9th in Asia's biggest Rivals tournament to date, Pacific Showdown. The main reason for Splash's placement on the PR is simple. His playstyle was agonizing enough to the point where multiple players hopped into a VC in order to find a way to counter it.  It was written in the elder scrolls that it was because of Splash that Asia discovered parry baiting. This was due to the fact that his playstyle involved multiple well-timed parries and efficient punishment utilizing crystal and up b that even the top players in Asia such as Teddd, Jim, and Sempai were bested by.
