<h1>Rivals of Asia PR 2022</h1>

<h2>Honorary Mentions</h2>

<h3>Niranoha</h3>
<p>Niranoha burst onto the scene in 2023, the tail-end of the season and picked up huge wins on both Aikawa and Splash during Asia Championship Series Finale. That alone would be enough to justify an honorable mention, but Nira followed up that performance by winning several post-season weeklies, collecting wins over VinZent, Porqpine, and others. It’ll be exciting to see what 2023 holds for the Japanese goat.</p>

<h3>TnR</h3>
<p>TnR, aka Times New Roman, aka Tax and Regulations, aka The stroNgest oRcane, showed up strong at the earlier events of the year. Unfortunately his geological position and thus his connection meant that he was later prohibited from competing. That cannot hide the truth that the man behind the stylish dolphin dog and the Clip Chain is one of Rivals of Asia's GOATs worthy of an honorable mention.
</p>

<h3>Knn217</h3>

<p>Many of the new players may not know about this legend but to veteran members, the three letters "KNN" used to strike fear into anyone who sees them in their bracket. He was KNN217: The Random Main.  Arguably one of the best players in early Rivals of Asia history in terms of fundamentals in order to pilot the unique cast that the game has.  After not participating in many tournaments throughout the year, KNN was able to place 5th at Pacific Gladiators, which secured his spot as an honorable mention.

<h2>#10 Splash</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920" data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span><source src="src/10 - SplashCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end"></span></video>

<p>The Fabled Fumbler himself made his first splash on the Asian scene back in early 2022, alongside the workshop patch. After making an outstanding run at Rivals Reset, Splash became a dominant force in Asia, placing 5th at Mauripop's Evil Incorporated and Skill Issue. He also placed 9th in Asia's biggest Rivals tournament to date, Pacific Showdown. The main reason for Splash's placement on the PR is simple. His playstyle was agonizing enough to the point where multiple players hopped into a VC in order to find a way to counter it.  It was written in the elder scrolls that it was because of Splash that Asia discovered parry baiting. This was due to the fact that his playstyle involved multiple well-timed parries and efficient punishment utilizing crystal and up b that even the top players in Asia such as Teddd, Jim, and Sempai were bested by.
</p>

<h2>#9 AcidAss</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/9 - AcidCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>AcidAss is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Workshop Patch. It started off rough as the charge character required quite some getting used to, but as he won the ASRAS Finals the funny monkey became not so funny anymore. Known as a combo fiend and clip monster, AcidAss' Hodan posted positive records vs Roya, Outis, and Splash, placing 7th at Swinter Wonderland, Mauripops Evil Inc., and ACS Finale.
</p>

<h2>#8 Outis</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/8 - OutisCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>A wise old man once said "Outis would be so much stronger if he stuck to Kragg." And he was... kinda right? Outis used Kragg for most of this season, placing 5th at Asian Elite Wrestling and 7th at Asia Cancels Summer, but his highest placing was actually 4th at Swinter Wonderland where he pulled out his patented Shovel Knight and took out Daylight, AcidAss, and Sempai. With Absa and Orcane also in his pocket, Outis' boasts game knowledge and skill as he makes his second PR appearance in a row.</p>

<h2>#7 Jim</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/7 - JimCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>
From hidden boss to consistent top 8 threat, Jim makes his mark at a solid 7th place. With a patient neutral and lethal punish, the lone Maypul in our top ten clearly made his breakthrough this year. Barring his 17th place at Pacific Gladiators at the start of the season, he has placed 9th or better in all majors he entered, with solid wins over the likes of Splash, Outis, Sempai, Daylight and Aikawa. Jim has become a staple in the Asian community, and we hope to see him improve and reach new heights during the next season.
</p>

<h2>#6 Teddd</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/6 - TedddCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Mr. Dashback Cape himself Teddd is a primordial being in Asia and is known for his insanely clever playstyle revolving around smoke placement and whiff punish, as well as his creative clone usage.  He'll have you second guessing whether or not to press the "A" button when you see a Forsburn coming at you.  Teddd has placed 3rd at Yetis’ Birthday Bash, 3rd at Mauripops Evil Incorporated, and 4th at Pacific Gladiators.  He has a positive record against fellow PR players such as Jim, Outis, Acid, and Sempai and has shown time and time again why having him in your bracket is pretty much a death sentence.
</p>

<h2>#5 Sempai</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/5 - SempaiCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Sempai took Asia by storm in several ways. Of the many newcomers the Workshop Patch brought, Sempai's Olympia proved to be a level higher than the rest, with his victory at Rivals of Asia Reset. He then returned to Ranno which proved to be the right move with positive records on Outis and AcidAss, and victories over Porqpine and Vinzent. Sempai's impressive placings like 2nd at Yetis' Birthday Bash and 3rd at Comeback Major earned his spot as Apex Predator (but not quite Sligma) on this season's PR
</p>

<h2>#4 Daylight</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/4 - DayCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Throughout 2021, Daylight was hyped up as a strong player from Japan who the Asian scene knew very little about. His big breakout to the rest of the scene came at Battle Gateway 35, where he took a set from Aikawa. He would make a smooth transition to online tournaments as well, bagging two 3rd places at both Asian Elite Wrestling and the ACS Finale. With his large cast of characters like Ori, Shovel Knight, Forsburn, and Hodan, Daylight secured wins over Sempai, Splash, Teddd, and Jim over the course of the season.
</p>

<h2>#3 Porqpine21</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/3 - PorqCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Asia's most famous fiery lion Porqpine lands himself at 3rd in this seasons PR. Whether it'd be by shine upsmash, fair shenanigans, or a string made up on the spot, he will catch you slacking, and he will kill you. Porqpine is known for his methodical style, dissecting his opponents' playstyle and taking advantage of every habit and opening he can. With wins over basically the entire PR, listing all his insane runs would be too extensive, but a big highlight would be his win over both Aikawa and Vinzent at Mauripops Evil Incorporated. With efforts in both TOing and general community wellbeing, Porq is here to stay, and we wouldn't want it any other way.
</p>

<h2>#2 Aikawa</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/2 - AikawaCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Aikawa entered the season as the next in line to inherit the Asian kingdom, with Bait leaving in the middle of the season, and him being a clear second the season prior, it seemed easy enough. His season, however, was rocky. After his second place in Pacific Gladiators, he ended up losing 3 straight sets to VinZent, making everyone wonder if he was really as untouchable as he had seemed prior. His middle portion of the season however was phenomenal, dropping only 1 tournament and sets to only 4 players over the span of 5 months. While his end of the season was disappointing, with his great performances throughout the season, the talented Fors- I mean Clai- I mean Kragg? main nets himself, once again, a second place.
</p>

<h2>#1 VinZent</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/1 - VinzCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>From his seemingly unending bag of Steam usernames, to his equally big bag of gameplay tricks, you never know what you’re getting when you watch a VinZent set, except pure entertainment. Vinz's strongest performance this season was definitely Skill Issue, where he took two sets from each of Yiffbait and Aikawa, becoming the first Asian player to win a tournament over Yiffbait. VinZent had a run that many thought was not possible, and that was his biggest case for the gold medal this season.
</p>

<h2>#0 Yiffbait</h2>
<video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="" width="1920"  data-mce-fragment="1"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><source src="src/0 - BaitCard.mp4"><span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_end">﻿</span></video>

<p>Going into the 2022 season, the question was always “will someone finally beat Yiffbait this season?”. Yiffbait undoubtedly delivered on these high expectations. Despite dropping one tournament to VinZent at Skill Issue, Yiffbait won every other tournament he entered, including Pacific Gladiators, the biggest tournament in Asian Rivals history. This season, he secured more online victories than any other player, while only playing for half of the season before moving back to Europe. Yiffbait displayed dominance while he was here, and the scene will definitely miss his presence moving forward.
